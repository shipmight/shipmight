# Logs

Shipmight includes a built-in log viewer interface, which can be used to monitor your apps. Option to download logs easily is also provided.

> **Note:** Browsing logs requires that Loki is installed in the cluster. See [Loki](Loki.md) for instructions. When Loki is not installed, some of the features below are hidden or disabled.

## Viewing logs

From the sidebar, select **Logs**. You will be redirected to a full-page log viewer:

From the left sidebar, you can adjust the time range and the apps for which you would like to view logs.

## Live-mode

In addition to selecting a date range, you can select the Live-mode, which will show the latest logs and pull in any new logs every second.

## Downloading logs

Sometimes you need to download logs for further processing. Shipmight includes this option as well.

From the sidebar, select **Tools**, which will open a modal:

In the modal you can make similar date range and source selections as before. Selections in the modal donâ€™t affect the selections outside the modal.

You can also choose from two output formats:

- **CSV**  
  Comma-separated data, no header. File extension: `.csv`

- **Newline delimited JSON**  
  Each line contains a JSON object. File extension: `.ndjson`

Downloaded files contain 4 columns: `datetime`, `nanoseconds`, `source`, `text`

## Viewing system logs

In addition to browsing app logs, Shipmight makes it easy to view and download logs for internal services in the cluster.

Under **Manage**, you can find two options for monitoring system logs.

- **Shipmight logs**  
  Logs from Shipmight stack containers, such as the Shipmight API, Loki and ingress-nginx.

- **kube-system logs**  
  Logs from containers in the kube-system namespace. The exact containers vary from Kubernetes distribution to distribution, but generally you can find containers like etcd (the key-value database used by Kubernetes) or the api-controller. All containers in kube-system relate to the internal workings of Kubernetes, and are not managed by Shipmight.

Selecting either option opens the full-screen log viewer interface.

Browsing these logs can be useful for troubleshooting.
