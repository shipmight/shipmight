## Before submitting a pull request

While I truly appreciate the willingness to submit a PR, for the time being PRs to this repository will be closed. Guiding PRs through the review process is too much work for me to take on currently. The codebase also evolves rapidly, which makes it even more difficult to accept community-provided PRs. Hopefully in the future accepting PRs will become viable!
